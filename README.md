# Ælish's Analysis Roadmap

A rigorous study plan designed to bridge calculus, real/complex/functional/spectral/numerical analysis, and geometric calculus, tailored to your background in GA, DSP, spectral geometry, and C++/GPU systems.

## Phase 1: Foundations in Rigorous Calculus (Spivak-first)

### Primary Text
- **Michael Spivak — Calculus**
  - Treat this as a first pass through real analysis with a geometric and proof-based lens.
  - Focus especially on epsilon-delta limits, differentiability, and the structure of integration.

### Supplement (Optional)
- **Abbott — Understanding Analysis**
  - Use for alternate explanations or conceptual refreshers.

### Goals
- Reconstruct calculus rigorously.
- Begin translating concepts into geometric algebra where possible (e.g., directional derivatives as blades).

### Companion Projects
- Implement numerical integration and differentiation algorithms.
- Write notes translating Spivak’s results into GA/GC equivalents.

## Phase 2: Multivariable Calculus & Differential Forms

### Primary Text
- **Spivak — Calculus on Manifolds**
  - Compact but rigorous treatment of multivariable calculus and differential forms.
  - Ideal precursor to geometric calculus and manifold theory.

### Supplement
- **Fleming — Functions of Several Variables** (for visual and intuitive reinforcement)

### Goals
- Develop fluency with gradient, divergence, curl via GA language.
- Understand the generalized Stokes’ theorem.

### Companion Projects
- Implement pullbacks of differential forms.
- Express exterior derivatives and integrals via wedge products in GA.

## Phase 3: Real and Metric Space Analysis

### Primary Text
- **Tao — Analysis I & II**
  - Reinforces real analysis with a set-theoretic, topological, and metric foundation.
  - Covers sequences, series, metric spaces, compactness, uniform convergence.

### Supplement (Optional)
- **Apostol Vol. I** (for more algebraically motivated treatments)

### Goals
- Generalize analysis beyond Euclidean space.
- Prepare for functional and spectral analysis.

## Phase 4: Complex Analysis

### Primary Text
- **Ahlfors — Complex Analysis** *or* **Stein & Shakarchi — Complex Analysis**
  - Explore analytic functions, Cauchy theory, residues, conformal maps.

### Goals
- Build fluency with analytic continuation, harmonic functions, and transformations in CGA.

### Companion Projects
- Visualize Möbius transforms and conformal maps using CGA.

---

## Phase 5: Functional Analysis

### Primary Text
- **Tao — Analysis III** *or* **Axler — Functional Analysis** *or* **Kreyszig — Intro to Functional Analysis**

### Topics
- Normed vector spaces, inner product spaces, Hilbert spaces, bounded linear operators, duality.

### Goals
- Understand structure of function spaces.
- Begin approaching spectral decompositions in Hilbert space.

### Companion Projects
- Implement operator representations numerically or symbolically.
- Connect Fourier bases and eigenfunctions to functional structure.

---

## Phase 6: Spectral Analysis & Operator Theory

### Primary Resources
- PDEs and Spectral Geometry texts (e.g., **Evans**, **Chavel**, or research papers)
- Discrete spectral geometry from a numerical perspective (e.g., **Levy**, **Crane**)

### Goals
- Understand eigenstructure of Laplacians on manifolds.
- Learn how differential operators encode geometry.

### Companion Projects
- Implement Laplacian eigensolvers on meshes.
- Study harmonic bases on surfaces using GA-compatible representations.

## Phase 7: Numerical Analysis and Spectral Methods

### Primary Texts
- **Trefethen — Spectral Methods in MATLAB**
- **Quarteroni — Numerical Mathematics**

### Goals
- Make analysis computational.
- Apply spectral/numerical analysis to real-time systems, PDEs, or DSP pipelines.

### Companion Projects
- Implement FFT-based PDE solvers.
- Use spectral basis decomposition for system modeling.

## Parallel Track: Geometric Algebra to Geometric Calculus

### Primary Texts
- **Doran & Lasenby — Geometric Algebra for Physicists**
- **Hestenes — New Foundations for Classical Mechanics**

### Goals
- Re-express calculus, analysis, and physics in the language of GA/GC.

### Projects
- Derive GC equivalents of vector calculus theorems.
- Use rotors, motors, and versors for physical systems modeling.
- Develop numerical library for blades, multivectors, and GC operators.

## Vault & Study Tips

- Build Obsidian vault with:
  - Chapter pages for each text
  - Cross-linked theorem glossaries
  - GA reinterpretation notes
- Maintain a visual graph linking concepts across analysis and GC.
- Periodically reflect on intuition vs rigor to keep engagement high.
